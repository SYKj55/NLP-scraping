# NLP-scraping
- This project was based on a problem statement requiring a list of blogs to be scraped and insights to be gathered from the data using NLP/
-	The data scraping and preprocessing was done using python and beautifulSoup library. All the links given in the input data were scraped.
-	I used two different scraping scripts depending on the structure of the webpage.
-	The scraped files were then cleaned using the stopwords provided in the test directory and sentiment analysis was performed for positive, negative, subjectivity and polarity score.
-	NLP was performed on the scraped data by removing stopwords as given in nltk and and then analysing the test for the specified parameters like average length and syllable.
-	The python files for the same are attached in this directory.
